                I have only done a few basic projects, which are available on my GitHub profile. Some of them are marked with a star. In those projects, I used simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Material UI, Bootstrap, and Firebase Authentication. The source code for almost all of the projects is open on my GitHub. Link:
